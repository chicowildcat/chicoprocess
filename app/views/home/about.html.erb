<h4>Chico State and AGCxml</h4>
 <p>In collaboration with the Associated General Contractors of America (AGC), Tracy Gateway Business Park. California State University, Chico, is providing online prototype applications to local contractors participating in the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) Bond Education Program. The object of the program is to improve access to surety credit through open standards.  Students from Chico State University majoring in Business Project Management and Computer Science are involved in the management and development of the project.  Concurrently, students from Chico Stare will identify necessary data fields to establish the "AGC Standard Data Set for Projects out to Bid" and the "AGC Standard Data Set for Company Profile." These two sets from AGC and Caltrans can then be used to improve efficiency and drive down costs.  As project partners, Caltrans will be implementing xgcXML for its procurement website and AGC is working with its membership so that any estimating systems will be able to import the Caltrans data using the standard data set and import the contractorâ€™s profile as part of a prequalification process or to set up a contractor record.  
We believe the work undertaken by the students at will prove invaluable to the industry and all the entities responsible for creating and maintaining an xml dictionary, but most of all it should be an incredible educational opportunity, said Jerry Hight, Assistant Dean, College of Engineering, Computer Science, and Construction Management at CSU Chico.  These students will learn to appreciate the nuances and detail that are behind computer systems while working to solve real world issues, and they will no doubt encounter conflicts and resistance as they strive to find consensus and deliver a final product.  </p>
